            <h3>This is Sam</h3>
            <p>This website is dedicated to my dearest friend Sam. Sam is a local Seattalite in his early 30â€™s looking to make money, hang out with family and friends, and enjoy every minute of everything he does. If you need to find your way around Seattle or even just find the best places to relax or eat, he's your guy. When not wandering the city or advocating for what he believes in, like discussing epilepsy and how it can affect one's life like his own, he likes to relax at his favorite place, his computer desk of course. He is one of the kindest people I have had the honor to work alongside on different projects and am looking forward to any future projects he may need help with. Sam can take up a serious side if needed but he prefers to be the fun friend looking to make you smile and keep everything lighthearted and joyful. Whether you need someone to listen to you during a bad day or you just want to hang out and have some company, Sam is your guy to bring a smile to your face. He's got a big family but currently is living with a sibling and their two beautiful cats. Right now he is between personal projects but to supplement that time he took up streaming his favorite games with a persona of his favorite animal by his side. Along with his great looks and personality he has got humor on his side and is even hoping one day his streaming could become a full time gig. If you are looking to gain a bit more insight on my dearest friend Sam you can check out his <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/da_duck" target="_blank">stream</a> and learn exactly what I am talking about.</p>
