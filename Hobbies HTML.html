            I was able to conduct a nice interview with Sam as well as take part in some of his favorite hobbies to ensure I had a proper grasp on who he is and what he likes to do for fun. A big part of Sam’s enjoyment when he is in his downtime is playing video games. Computer games have been a part of his life for the last 15+ years and he doesn’t see himself slowing down now. I joined Sam on Steam, a platform to purchase and play all sorts of games whether single-player or multiplayer. He prefers multiplayer games of all varieties, as long as he has his friends there. When Sam is not enjoying video games he prefers to spend his extra free time with his 2 cats, Emi and AJ. Both are his pride and joys and he spends a lot of time ensuring they have everything they need to be comfortable and happy little kitties. A lot of the time while he hangs out with his kitties he enjoys cooking, whether a big intricate meal for him and his sibling or a cute little treat for his cats, he loves being in the kitchen. The last of Sam’s biggest hobbies is that he enjoys streaming on Twitch. In his free time he likes to set up his webcam, set up screen share, and show off to his many viewers all of his favorite games. Sam is an avid duck enjoyer so he was sure to use ducks as his running theme to keep viewers coming back for more. For a small span of time I was able to moderate for his channel, or watch chat and his stream to make sure things were running smoothly. It allowed me to see what all his streaming hobby really needed including keeping his chat happy, keeping the stream running smoothly, and keeping track of time so that he could properly set up his next event.
